# sleepingBarberProblem I solved this problem with semaphores in c programming language. There are detailed description below:
The barber shop there are n piece chairs in waiting room and m piece barber seat.
If there is not customer, barber goes sleep.
If all chairs are full and customer come in, customer comes out from shop.
If barber is shaving the customer but there is empty chair, customer sits down the chair.
If a customer come in shop while barber is sleeping, customer wakes the barber.
